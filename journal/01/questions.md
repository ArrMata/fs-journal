# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > Allows for a seamless experience of working on the same codebase with other developers since you push your code
    > to the same branch which should update for other developers. Also allows for version control, making it easy to 
    > revert changes.

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > Make directory.

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > Pseudo-classes are states that an element can be in, such as hovered or focused. I personally have used :hover the
    > most for things like buttons and nothing else too commonly.

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > Specificity is how CSS determines which rule to apply to an element in the DOM. Because of this, specificty is
    > useful for me to be able to make CSS classes that I only want to apply to certain elements and not others.

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > It can mess with the specificity built into CSS, and overrule something unexpected. With specificity built into CSS, 
    > you should design your CSS rules in a way that you shouldn't have to use !important.

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > Selector, property, and value.

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > Good design allows for a better user experience, both through accessibility and experience. Through good design alone, you can convey that certain elements are more important than others or allow for information to be more easily digested.

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > Wireframing's purpose is to build out the UI of the website, focusing on user experience and accessibility without being distracted by things like color, font, etc.

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > Yes, I believe they are worth the time. They require very little energy, especially when starting from a low-fidelity wireframe, and help layout a clean idea of how an app should be laid out. More importantly, I think it gets everyone involved on the same page about a design.

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > Applying the display: flex property to an element makes the content within that element be laid out, by default, horizontally and allows the use of flexbox properties, like justify-content or align-items, to adjust how the content is laid out.

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > The CSS properties that affect a box model are width, height, margin and padding.
